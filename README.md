# Machine-Learning-Projects

Below are the three Machine Learning Projects and the corresponding repositories:

## Charity data Analysis with Neural Network

Deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, is used to analyze, classify and optimize the success of charitable donations. Following methods are performed for the analysis:

* Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
* Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Optimize the Model

## Cryptocurrencies Analysis

Creating a classification system for this new investment to report what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped.

The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, unsupervised learning is used. Also clustering algorithm and data visualizations are used to group the cryptocurrencies and to share the findings. 

Below are the list of process followed:

* Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Credit Card risk Analysis

In this project machine learning is used to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, different techniques need to be employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries are used to build and evaluate models using resampling.

The RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms are used to oversample the data, and the ClusterCentroids algorithm are used to undersample the data. Then, the SMOTEENN algorithm is implemented for the combinatorial approach of over and undersampling. 

Next, the new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias are compared to predict credit risk. Finally all these model performance are evaluated to produce a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
